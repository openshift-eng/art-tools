          False positive: This code implements defense-in-depth SSRF protection with multiple validation layers:
          (1) Base URL allowlist check against SECURE_PROXY_ENDPOINTS
          (2) Path validation rejecting traversal sequences, URL schemes, credentials, and malicious patterns
          (3) URL parsing validation using URL constructor
          (4) Hostname allowlist verification against ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES before any fetch operation
          (5) Final URL prefix verification ensuring constructed URL matches allowlisted endpoints

          The code is a secure proxy that only forwards requests to pre-approved Red Hat content gateway endpoints.
          User input (remainingPath) undergoes extensive validation before being used. Static analysis cannot trace
          through the validation logic, but the code is secure by design.
