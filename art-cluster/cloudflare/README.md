# Cloudflare Cluster Configurations

## Overview

This project provides critical backend support for managing access, secrets, and file handling within Cloudflare-based clusters. It ensures secure, authenticated access to sensitive resources and facilitates dynamic content delivery and storage management.

## Key Features

- **Access Control**: Implements secure Basic Authentication to protect private paths, ensuring only authorized users can access resources under `/enterprise`, `/libra`, and `/pockets` directories.
- **Secrets Management**: Manages sensitive credentials for service accounts using secure environment variables and integrates with Cloudflare R2 buckets.
- **File Management**: Handles file listing, downloading, and object storage within R2 buckets, including support for dynamic path management and rendering of directory listings.
- **Static Asset Delivery**: Supplies necessary assets such as SVGs, CSS, and favicons for the system's frontend interface.

## How It Works

The system checks the access level for different paths within the Cloudflare cluster and verifies the user's credentials using Base64-encoded Basic Auth. It manages static content like files and folders in R2 buckets, handling special cases like 404 errors or empty folders. Dynamic paths are also processed, adjusting access based on user roles.
