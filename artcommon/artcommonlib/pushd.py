"""
This file contains the definition of a class that can be used like shell
pushd and popd.

The Dir object is a context_manager that can be used with the Python 'with'
clause.  The context manager idiom allows the user to execute some commands
in a working directory other than the CWD and return without needing to
explicitly handle it.

    any previous Dir context's cwd is restored.

    The current directory of the process (e.g. os.getcwd()) is never altered
    as this would not be a threadsafe operation.
